# PRODIGY_CS_01
Implementation of Caesar cipher algorithm
This Python script allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption method that shifts each letter in the text by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

How to Use:
Run the script:

python caesar_cipher.py
Choose the mode:

Enter 'e' to encrypt the message.
Enter 'd' to decrypt the message.
Input the message you wish to encrypt or decrypt.

Enter the shift value (key) for the cipher.

View the result: The script will display the encrypted or decrypted message.

Example:

Would you like to 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' the message? ('e' or 'd') e
Enter your message: Hello World
Enter the shift value (key): 3
The resulting text is: Khoor Zruog
Features
Encryption: Shifts each letter in the input text by a user-defined number of positions.
Decryption: Reverses the shift to restore the original text.
